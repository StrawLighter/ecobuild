# EcoBuild — Colosseum Agent Hackathon

## Vision
EcoBuild turns waste collection into a Solana-powered construction economy. Players verify cleanup efforts, earn tokenized material credits, and direct them toward community building projects orchestrated by autonomous agents.

## Hackathon Deliverables
- **Solana Program (Anchor)** handling player registration, verified material submissions, and project material vaults.
- **Openclaw Agent Workers** for submission verification, on-chain interactions, allocation logic, and reward issuance.
- **Demo Dashboard** visualizing player standings and real-time project progress.
- **Forum & Project Assets** including ideation posts, progress updates, and submission materials.

## Immediate Tasks
1. Register hackathon agent ✅
2. Scaffold GitHub repo + local project structure
3. Design Solana program accounts & instructions
4. Draft agent workflow diagrams
5. Implement MVP verification + submission pipeline
6. Build lightweight dashboard for demo
7. Prepare project entry (description, Solana integration write-up)

## Open Questions
- Final decision on material token representation (SPL token vs. metadata NFT)
- Choice of CV verification stack for MVP (hosted model vs. stub)
- Integration partners for mock rewards (sponsors, community groups)
